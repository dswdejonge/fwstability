\title{Normalize the Jacobian matrix}
\usage{
normalizeJacobian(JM, dead_names = NULL, allzero = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{JM}{(required) A square named Jacobian matrix with numeric values representing
the effect of one compartment (rows) on another compartment (columns).
The diagonal must be quantified, and cannot contain zeroes.}

\item{dead_names}{(required if allzero is TRUE and there are dead compartments in the system)
Character vector with the names of all dead compartments.}

\item{allzero}{Boolean. Default TRUE. Sets all diagonal values - except for dead compartments -
to zero after normalisation. If set to FALSE, the normalized Jacobian will have -1 for each diagonal
value.}
}
\value{
Returns a normalized Jacobian matrix with either an all-zero (except detritus) diagonal
or a diagonal with -1.
}
\description{
This function normalizes the Jacobian matrix by dividing each row by
the corresponding absolute diagonal value.
}
\examples{
model <- fwmodels::LovinkhoeveCP
JM <- getJacobian(model)
# Normalize the matrix, all diagonal values will be set to 0 after normalization
normalizeJacobian(JM)
# Normalize the matrix, all diagonal values will be set to -1 after normalization
normalizeJacobian(JM, allzero = FALSE)
