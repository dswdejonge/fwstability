\title{Get loop weight.}
\usage{
getLoopWeight(IS, d = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{IS}{(required) Numeric vector of length \code{k} with all
interaction strengths from a loop.}

\item{d}{(optional) Numeric vector of length \code{k} with natural
death rates of all compartments included in the loop with the same unit as \code{IS}.}
}
\value{
Returns a double.
}
\description{
This function calculates the loop weight.
}
\details{
Loop weight is defined as the geometric mean of all absolute
interaction strengths in a loop of length k. It combines information on
the feedback of the loop with natural death rates and the length of
the loop. The feedback is scaled by the natural death rates as in Neutel et al. 2007,
because the stability measure is also scaled by death rates. Depending on
your stability measure you can decide to omit inclusion of death rates.
