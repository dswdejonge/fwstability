\title{Assess probability of destabilizing system per interaction}
\usage{
assessLinksPerm(
  JM,
  method = "eigenvalue",
  MR = NULL,
  dead_names = NULL,
  perms = 100,
  threshold = 0.01,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{JM}{(required) A square named Jacobian matrix with numeric values representing the effect of one compartment (rows)
on another compartment (columns).}

\item{method}{(required) Either "eigenvalue" (default), "scalar", or "initial".
\itemize{
\item{
The method "eigenvalue" finds asymptotic stability as the maximum real part of the eigenvalues
calculated from the Jacobian matrix.
}
\item{
The "scalar" method finds asymptotic stability as the scalar of natural mortality
rates needed to acquire a stable matrix.
}
\item{
The "initial" method finds initial stability as equation 4 from Arnoldi et al. (2016);
initial stability is half the maximum real part of the eigenvalues derived from the
matrix obtained by addition of the Jacobian matrix to its transpose.
}
}}

\item{MR}{(required if method is "scalar")
A named numeric vector containing mortality of the faunal compartments
(per unit time, t-1). The values and names must be in the same
order as the Jacobian matrix, and the values for dead compartments should be
set to NA.}

\item{dead_names}{(optional if method is "scalar") Character vector with all names of detritus and nutrient
compartments (everything that is not fauna).}

\item{perms}{(required) Default is 100. Number of times a pair of interaction strengths
is varied.}

\item{threshold}{(required) Default is 0.01. The Jacobian matrix is set at this fraction below
the stability threshold before starting permutations.}

\item{seed}{(required) Default is 1. Set seed to allow reproducibility of results.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with the probability (0 to 1) of destabilizing the system for each
pair of trophic interactions.
}
\description{
This function determines the probability that a system becomes unstable if the
strengths in a pair of interactions are varied.
}
\details{
First, the diagonal of the Jacobian matrix is altered so that the matrix is
just stable. This is done by subtracting the maximum real part of the eigenvalues from the
diagonal values, and subsequently reducing the diagonal values by a fraction
(in argument \code{threshold}). The default threshold of 0.01 is used in De Ruiter et al. (1995).
Peter de Ruiter mentions through personal communication that this threshold method is a bit outdated,
and that he personally recommends setting the diagonal to zero. You can achieve this by setting
\code{threshold} to \code{NULL}.
\cr
Every pair of interaction strengths is then randomly varied between 0 and 2aij a certain
number of times. The probability that the food web becomes unstable is the total count of
unstable matrices divided by the total number of permutations.
\cr
Using the method 'scalar' to asses stability might be somewhat slower than the method 'eigenvalue'.
\cr
Beware that where \code{assessLinksFixed} reports the **absolute and relative** effect on stability
of altering **one** interaction strength according to a **fixed** function,
this function \code{assessLinksPerm} reports the **probability** that the matrix becomes unstable
when a **pair** of interaction strengths in altered between 0 and 2 time the original interaction
strength a certain number of times.
