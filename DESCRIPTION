Description: The package can be used to estimate stability and biological tipping points from energy-flux food web models. It takes in an energy-flux food web model with fluxes, conversion efficiencies, and information on mortality and excretion, and uses this to calculate interaction strengths. These interaction strengths are the elements of a Jacobian matrix that can be used in stability analysis.
