# Automatically include lim model into the getJacobian matrix.
# Format needs to be so that the function can automatically find:
# - flow matrix
# - biomasses
# - assimilation efficiencies
# - growth efficiencies
# - mortality rates
# - dead compartments
# - defecation flows
# - parallel flows to defecation into the same compartment
# - externals
# - getXratioMatrix

# Import lim model

# solve lim model

# use solved lim model in getJacobian
# write tests for all individual functions (getFlowMatrix, getAEmatrix, etc.)
# getFM has bug.


# test against expected outcome.
