\title{Calculate Jacobian diagonal from flux values}
\usage{
getDiagonal(MR, BM, dead = NULL, FM = NULL, AE = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{MR}{A named numeric vector with non-predatory mortality rates for all
compartments (biomass per unit time or biomass per unit time per surface area).
(required)}

\item{BM}{A named numeric vector with biomasses of all compartments
(just biomass or biomass per unit area), must be in the same order as MR. (required)}

\item{dead}{Character vector with all names of detritus and nutrient
compartments (everything that is not fauna). (optional)}

\item{FM}{A named square flowmatrix, source compartments as rows,
sink compartments as columns. Should NOT contain external compartments. Order of names
must be equal to MR. (required when dead compartments are included)}

\item{AE}{A named numeric vector with assimilation efficiencies of all
compartments, must be in the same order as MR. Must be a fraction i.e. between 0 and 1.
(required when dead compartments are included)}
}
\value{
This function returns a named numeric vector with diagonal values for the
species in the food web (per unit time). It is important to review the units of the
input data. If MR is biomass per unit time then BM must be just biomass. If MR is
biomass per unit time per surface area then BM must be biomass per surface area.
}
\description{
This function finds diagonal values to be used in the Jacobian matrix based on flux
values. Diagonal values for species depend on their non-predatory mortality rate and
biomass. Diagonal values for dead (detritus) compartments are based on the total amount
of assimilated detritus in all consumers of detritus and the biomass of the detritus
compartments. This function implements the equations from from Neutel & Thorne (2014).
The input should be named according to the food web compartment names. \cr
