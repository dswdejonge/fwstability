\title{Per capita effect on consumer population.}
\usage{
effectOnConsumer(FM, BM, AE, GE)
}
\arguments{
\item{FM}{A square flowmatrix, source compartments as rows,
sink compartments as columns.}

\item{BM}{Numeric vector with biomasses of all compartments, must be in the same order as the flow matrix.}

\item{AE}{Numeric vector with assimilation efficiencies of all
compartments,must be in the same order as the flow matrix.}

\item{GE}{Numeric vector with growth efficiencies of all compartments,
must be in the same order as the flow matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing interaction strengths - measured as the
effect of the resources (rows) on the consumers (columns) - for all
interactions in the food web.
}
\description{
This function finds the per capita effect of a resource on the growth
of the consumer population. It uses functions from de Ruiter et al.
(1995) and Neutel et al. (2002). The flow from resource to consumer is
adjusted for conversion efficiency and divided by the biomass of the
resource.
